# Greenback'd Ethereum Dapp

## Steps to install and run
### Setup
* Install Metamask and start running on a test network (doesn't matter which one)
### Project 
* `cd` to `greenbackd/` and run `npm install` to install npm dependencies
* `npm run build` to compile contracts and package static files
* `serve` to host files locally (install if you don't have it)
*  Navigate to `localhost:3000/dist/index.html`. At this point you should get a pop-up from Metamask asking if you want to deploy the contract `greenbackd.sol`.
